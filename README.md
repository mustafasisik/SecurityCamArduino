# SecurityCamArduino

You can find the codes for esp32-cam on the iot side, which is one of the 3 parts of the Security Cam project.
When editing the code, you need to change the firebase link and secret-key.
Here pin 2 is used as button, while pin 12 is used as button led, while safety status is at low level, pin 13 gives high voltage to illuminate the other led.
